# A place to store information about c-tutorials

## C Information
- Low level language
- Import header file that contains function that you need, but don't need to append header file name to function used in code.
- C will overflow its variable types and wrap around to the start of the type's range.
- gcc compilier gives you warnings on how you assign variables and if you assign the wrong type.

### Constants
- define by the following
```
const int AGE = 37
or 
#define AGE 37 (c compilier will infer type)
```

### C Unary Operators (take one operand)
+a
-a
a++ (increments variable after using it) or ++a (increments variable before using it)
a-- or --a

### Logical Operators
Not !
OR ||
AND &&

### Ternary Operator
```
<condition> ? <expression> : <expression>
```

### Missing Bitwise operators, structure operators, and pointer operators.
